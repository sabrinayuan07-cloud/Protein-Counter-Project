# Protein Tracker Application

## Proposal

What will the application do?
- The application will help people keep track of their daily protein intake without needing to look up the amount of protein for each item in their meal. At the end of the day, they can save their intake, which will be stored in a calendar so they can track their protein intake over time. 

Who will use it?
- Anyone who wants to track their protein can use it.

Why is this project of interest to you?
